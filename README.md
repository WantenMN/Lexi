# Notice: Discontinuation of Lexi Project

Dear Future Lexi Users,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have decided to discontinue the development of the Lexi project. As the sole developer behind this endeavor, I have come to realize that the fundamental idea and objectives of the application are not aligned with effective English language learning practices.

The initial concept behind Lexi was to create a tool to assist in expanding vocabulary by extracting words from articles. However, upon careful consideration, I have come to understand that isolating words from their contextual environment may not provide an optimal learning experience. Focusing solely on a single meaning of a word, without considering its usage within an article, may not sufficiently support language comprehension and acquisition.

I deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you as a potential user. I value your feedback and strive to create applications that truly enhance your language learning journey. It is with this in mind that I have made the difficult decision to discontinue Lexi, ensuring that you receive the most effective and beneficial language learning tools.

Thank you for your understanding and interest in Lexi. Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Sincerely,

Wanten
